## ✅ Part 1: Macro Recorder, VBA Concepts & Logic Statements

In this section, we introduce the foundational concepts of Excel automation using the Macro Recorder and VBA. It's ideal for beginners transitioning from manual Excel tasks to programmable workflows.

### 🔹 Key Skills Covered
- Recording macros to automate repetitive Excel tasks
- Understanding generated VBA code from macros
- Using the VBA editor to modify and write procedures
- Implementing control flow using `If`, `Else`, `For`, `Do While`, and `Do Until` loops
- Working with Excel Object Model (Workbook, Worksheet, Range)

### 📂 Files Included
- `COM-InsertingAndFormattingText.xlsm`: Demonstrates macro-recorded automation for inserting and formatting cells
- `COM-ExcelVBALoops.xlsm`: Showcases various loop constructs in VBA to manipulate Excel data dynamically

### 🧰 Concepts Introduced
- **Macro Recorder**: Automatically generates VBA code based on recorded actions in Excel
- **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**: Object-oriented programming language integrated with Excel
- **Object Model**: Hierarchical structure of Excel elements that VBA interacts with
- **Procedures & Modules**: Basic building blocks for reusable and organized code

### 🎯 Learning Outcome
By the end of this part, you’ll be able to:
- Record and review macros
- Write and execute your first VBA procedure
- Use conditional logic and loops
- Automate common cell-level tasks like formatting and text insertion
